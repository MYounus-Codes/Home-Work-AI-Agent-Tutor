## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homework-tutor.git
cd homework-tutor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GOOGLE_SEARCHING_API_KEY=your_google_search_api_key
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_google_cse_id
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## Usage

- Open the app in your browser (if using Chainlit, it will provide a local URL).
- Start chatting!  
  Example questions:
  - "How do I solve quadratic equations?"
  - "Explain Newton's second law."
  - "Show me a video tutorial on integration."
  - "What is the formula for kinetic energy?"
